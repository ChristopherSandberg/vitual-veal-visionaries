{"Id":0,"Title":"A Layman\u2019s Guide to Astrophysics","Content":"Astrophysics, a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to explain the birth, life, and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe has been fascinating humans for centuries.\n\nWe might not be astrophysicists, but simple understanding of these massive universal concepts could still provide enlightening and thought-provoking insights about the very universe that we\u0027re a part of.\n\nSo, where do we start?\n\nFirstly, we can\u0027t really discuss astrophysics without mentioning the \u0027Big Bang\u0027. Not the show, the theory. It\u0027s widely accepted that some 13.8 billion years ago, an infinitely dense, hot point \u2013 or singularity \u2013 expanded and the universe as we know it began.\n\nSecondly, gravity. It\u0027s universal and it\u2019s what keeps us from floating off into space. It\u0027s also the driving force behind the formation of galaxies and the birth of stars.\n\nLastly, we have Dark Matter and Dark Energy. They may sound like terms from a science fiction novel, but they\u2019re just labels for things we don\u2019t quite understand yet. They make up 95% of the universe, so they\u2019re quite important.\n\nIf everything you\u2019ve read so far sounds interesting and you\u2019d like to know more, read on. There\u2019s a universe of knowledge waiting to be explored!","Author":"Martin S. Cosgrove","CreatedAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}
