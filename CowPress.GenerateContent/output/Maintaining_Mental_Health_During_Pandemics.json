{"Id":0,"Title":"Maintaining Mental Health During Pandemics","Content":"The rapidly changing news of a pandemic outbreak can cause anyone to feel worried. By managing our mental health in times of crisis, we can not only protect our own wellbeing but also help others to do the same.\n\nAlthough it\u0027s essential to stay informed during times such as these, one should also embrace activities that were part of their routines before the pandemic. Whether it\u0027s reading a book, painting, or practicing yoga at home, concentrate on maintaining balance and reducing stress.\n\nReaching out to friends and family over the phone or through video calls can provide comfort, and create a sense of togetherness even though we might physically be apart. It also helps to take a break and reflect rather than continually revolve around pandemic news.\n\nAnother aspect of maintaining mental health during pandemics is to set boundaries on how you consume news and information about the current situation. It can be helpful to limit checking updates to specific times in the day and to be aware of the possible impact of reading or watching upsetting reports.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s okay to feel scared or anxious. Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations. Embrace your feelings, understand them and react appropriately. If required, seek help from mental health professionals. They can provide guidance and resources to cope with anxiety and stress.\n\nRemember, mental health is just as crucial to manage as physical health. Stay safe, stay calm, and together, we can make it through these challenging times.","Author":"Benjamin Grayson","CreatedAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}
